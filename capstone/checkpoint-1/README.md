Business Issue:
The primary goal of this analysis is to suggest methods to increase revenue for the hotel by mining the hotel booking data as best as possible. Furthermore, providing insight into how they can pivot their business in small ways to maximize returns and reduce resource waste. Among other things, I will examine how ADR varies across different lead times, evaluate the customer reach by types of customers, and explore best practices for adjusting ADR based on demand fluctuations.
